// highlight.pack.js

// This file is a placeholder for the actual highlight.js library.
// The actual library is quite large and should be downloaded from the official source:
// https://highlightjs.org/download/
// After downloading, replace this file with the actual library.

// The library will provide the hljs object and its methods, which will be used to apply syntax highlighting to the code blocks.

// Example usage (after including the library in your project):
// hljs.highlightBlock(block);
